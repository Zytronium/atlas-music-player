# Atlas Music Player

## Getting Started

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
- Open `http://localhost:5173` in a browser

### Important Files/Folders

- `src`: All javascript/jsx code goes in this directory
- `src/assets`: Any static assets such as images that are loaded through the javascript files goes here.
- `index.html`: This is the html file that appears when the dev server starts up.
- `src/app.tsx`: This is the main app component for the entire app.

### Important Commands

- `npm run dev`: Starts dev server with Hot Module Reloading on port 5173. Anytime a file changes, the changes will automatically be reflected in the browser
- `npm run lint`: Run the lint checker with eslint to check for known linting issues
- `npm run build`: Outputs the production files into the `dist` folder
- `npm run dist-prev`: Outputs the prod files into the `dist` folder AND runs an express server to preview it (since dev version can sometimes differ from the dist version)  
> Note: `npm run dist-prev` does the same thing as `npm run build; npm run preview` from what I can tell, so I will stop including this in my future projects.
